# CS 333 Introduction to Operating Systems

**Course Coordinator:** Jesse Chaney 

## Course Description:

Introduction to the principles of operating systems and concurrent programming. Operating system services, file systems, resource management, synchronization. The concept of a process; process cooperation and interference. Introduction to networks, and protection and security. Examples drawn from one or more modern operating systems. Programming projects, including concurrent programming.

**Prerequisites:** CS 302

## Goals:

- To expose students to the fundamental architectural and algorithmic concepts involved in the design and implementation of modern operating systems. This will include the design and coding of concurrent programs.
- Upon the successful completion of this class, students will be able to:
  - Read technical material that refers to operating system concepts.
  - Write system-level code.
  - Apply synchronization-related concerns when implementing code.
  - Continue on to study advanced operating systems.
  - Describe observed application runtime behavior.

## Major Topics:

- Processes
- Inter-process communication
- Concurrent Programming
- Scheduling
- Memory Management
- File Systems
- Synchronization
- Device Management
- Introductions to Protection & Security and to Networking

## Problem Analysis:

Students complete a variety of projects that require problem analysis, design, coding, and testing. For example, students might design a shell program based on knowledge of desired shell behavior, or design and add synchronization to a multithreaded code. Specific projects vary for each course offering.

## Solution Design:

One or more projects require solution design, for example, changing existing code to remove a race condition.
